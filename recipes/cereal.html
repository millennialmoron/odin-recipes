        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Craving a bowl of processed sugar? Look no further.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Your chosen cereal</li>
                <li>(Optional) More sugar to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the desired amount of your chosen cereal in your favorite bowl. If you've elected to add more
                    sugar, do
                    so now.</li>
                <li>Add milk to desired level. There is some debate over the order of milk and cereal in the bowl, and
                    honestly
                    it probably doesn't matter. Except it does and if you do it any other way, you're wrong.</li>
                <li>(Optional) Drink remaining milk after cereal is gone. Some people feel very strongly about this
                    because
                    if
                    you don't drink this milk, you're apparently wasting it and therefore a terrible person. Nevermind
                    processing and other considerations involved in the life choices of eating the processed sugar, if
                    you
                    feel
                    so inclined, drink the extra sugary milk remaining in the bowl after you've eaten your cereal.</li>
            </ol>
