    <h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>
    <p>All the Tex-Mex goodness of a normal quesadilla, with a breakfasty spin, this
        crispy, toasted tortilla pocket holds eggs, bacon, and cheese.</p>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 eggs</li>
        <li>18 slices of bacon (cooked, so you don't get worms, and crumbled, like all your failed relationships)</li>
        <li>12 (8-in) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>12 tbsp butter (softened, but not melted, so don't just stick it in the microwave)</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>6 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese (or dealer's choice, except Velveeta...don't be that person)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste (not literally, although if you're into that, no judgment I guess)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick the large bowl of your choice and scramble the eggs (preferably without the shells). You could do
            whites only if you wanna be a health nut or yokes only if you're feeling the need for extra protein. But you
            may need to supplement with more than the called for amount of eggs. Whisk the eggs with salt and pepper,
            then add crumbled bacon, mix well, making sure there's plenty of air bubbles in the mixture.</li>
        <li>Spray a large wok with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. (If necessary, a smaller skillet and
            divisions of the egg mixture may be used in the event a large enough cooking wok isn't possessed by the
            chef.) Pour the egg mixture into the wok; cook until eggs start to set on the bottom of the wok, then use a
            spatula to slowly move/scramble the mixture as it cooks through. When the eggs are mostly solid, keeping in
            mind they'll continue to cook some after you remove them from the heat, remove the mixture and get a
            different skillet ready.</li>
        <li>Butter one side of every tortilla. Be careful not to drop them, as Murphy's Law dictates they will fall
            buttered side down.</li>
        <li>Warm a tortilla-sized skillet over medium heat. And get ready to assemble these quickly, because time will
            not be on your side.</li>
        <li>Place one tortilla buttered side down in the skillet. Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese, evenly distributing aroung
            the tortilla. Spoon about 1/12 of the egg mixture and evenly disperse around <em><strong>half</strong></em>
            the tortilla on top of the cheese. Be aware that too much mixture will make the quesadilla too thick. This
            is quesadilla blasphemy. Do not overfill. Fold the un-egged portion of the tortilla over the egged portion
            to make a tortilla-pocket of cheesy-eggy-bacony goodness. Watch for the bottom tortilla half to be nicely
            brown, then carefully flip like a pancake, brown the other side, and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Repeat for the remaining 11 quesadillas.</li>
        <li>Enjoy with friends. Or alone. No judgment.</li>
    </ol>
