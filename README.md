This is a recipe book.

If you've ever felt inclined to make 12 breakfast quesadillas, this is for you.

If you've ever wondered how to make a single piece of french toast, this is for you.

If you've ever gotten confused trying to figure out cereal, this is for you.

Just recipes. No stories. Some sarcasm.
